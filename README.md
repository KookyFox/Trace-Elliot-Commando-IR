# Trace Elliot Commando IR collection

This is a collection of Impulse Responses profiled with LSP Profiler from a Trace Elliot Commando Bass Amp (date of manufacture circa late 80s, found in perfect condition in a dump; yes for free).

A Micparts modded Studio Projects C1 was used for the profiling capture, with a -20dB pad.

For now only profiled with all EQs at noon

## The Amp

The amplifier is a Trace Elliot Commando 1x15 150W combo from the late 80s. It's a versatile solid state amp, with handy tone stack push button for quick modifiers.

The amp sounds anywhere from clean to meaty with a nice range on the gain knob. making pretty useless for crunch effects. It's good for everything; do note that it responds best around 110Hz, especially with Mid Shift engaged.

### Prerequisites

To use the IRs you'll need any convolver that can use mono IRs (so really just about any convolver). Though if you are on linux I recommend LSP Impulse Responses.


### File Naming

The folders correspond to the tonestack modifier buttons, and contain each 3 different gain levels, volume knob and mic preamp used to match max amplitude of the IR.
